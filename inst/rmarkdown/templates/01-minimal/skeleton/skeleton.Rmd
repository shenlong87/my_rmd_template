## Introduction

This is a very minimal example! The only thing which is changed in this template is a few of the default settings in the YAML. 

## Customisation

A simple template like this might be useful to include if you have a common structure of report that you want to run. For example, you change the author name your name. You can edit the sections to include a generic layout.
